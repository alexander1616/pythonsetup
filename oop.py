# Watto needs a new system for organizing his inventory of podracers. 
# Help him do this by implementing an Object Oriented solution according to the following criteria.

# First, he'll need a general Podracer class defined with max_speed, condition (perfect, trashed, repaired) and price attributes. 
class Podracer:
  def __init__(self, max_speed, condition, price):
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.condition = condition
    self.price = price

  # Define a repair() method that will update the condition of the podracer to "repaired".
  def repair(self):
    self.condition = "repaired"
    
# Define a new class, AnakinsPod that inherits the Podracer class, but also contains a special method called boost that will multiply max_speed by 2.
class AnakinsPod(Podracer):
  def __init__(self, max_speed, condition, price):
    super.init(max_speed, condition, price)
  
  def boost(self):
    self.max_speed *= 2
    
# Define another class that inherits Podracer and call this one SebulbasPod. 
# This class should have a special method called flame_jet that will update the condition of another podracer to "trashed".
class SebulbasPod(Podracer):
  def __init__(self, max_speed, condition, price):
    super.init(max_speed, condition, price)
  
  def flame_jet(self,other):
    other.condition = "trashed"

Make sure to answer the following prompts about your coding experience:
How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP? (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)

inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, extraction
inherting: properites of parent
encapsulating: our input
polymorphism: override parents method
abstraction: hiding complexity from user, some abstraction methods called are things users don't need to know

Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?

functional programming can do this better

How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?

using all of the four pillars achieved the goal well
